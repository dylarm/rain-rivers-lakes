# RRL - Rain, Rivers, & Lakes

Modeling simple rainfall and subsequent rivers and lakes using agent/individual-based modeling.


## Installation

1. Install [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/download.shtml), preferrably v6.0.
There shouldn't be any 6.0-specific idioms/commands/magic used, but I can't guarantee it.
2. At the moment, nothing else since there's nothing just yet.


## Usage

If you know how to use NetLogo, that's great.
But at the moment, I'm just piecing together the pieces that I need in order to have a sort of proof of concept.


## Credits
